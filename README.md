Railo Express Development Environment
=====================
This is a dead simple RAILO EXPRESS CFML DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT for Mac OS X / Linux.
Support for Windows may come soon but may be in a separate repository.

It also enables the ability to initialize a Railo context from any directory by doing the following:
```
$> mkdir -p ~/Projects/my_new_cfml_project
$> cd ~/Projects/my_new_cfml_project
$> railo_init
```

For more information about this technique, you can see an article by Mark Drew regarding his "railo_runner" technique that him and I thought up.
