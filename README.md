Groom your app's CFML dev environment.
=====================

## Installation
### With Installer
- Open your Terminal.
- Copy/Paste `bash <(curl -s http://get.cfenv.co/scripts/install.sh)`
- It may take a few seconds to show any output depending on the speed of the server.

### With Homebrew on Mac OS X
- `brew update`
- `brew install cfenv`

More information coming very soon!

## ToDo
- Add Linux support to the installer... shouldn't be that hard really just haven't had time.
- Add Windows support... may have to go in separate repo?  Who knows...
