<h2>Getting Started with Railo</h2>
<p>Thank You for Downloading Railo - an ultra fast Open Source CFML Engine.

<h3>Starting Railo</h3>
<p>To start the Railo service, simply run the start script for your environment, e.g. <em>start.bat</em> for Windows, or <em>start</em> for Linux or Mac OSX.

<p>By default Railo runs on TCP port 8888, so once you run it on your local machine, for example, you can test that it is working by visiting <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</a>

<h3>Running Your Own Code</h3>
<p>The default folder that runs as the web root is <em>{this-folder}/webapps/www</em>

<p>To test out your own code simply place it in that folder and browse to the URL above.

<h3>Railo Administrator</h3>
<p>The Railo Server Administrator is available at the virtual folder <em>/railo-context/admin/server.cfm</em> so once you have Railo running on this machine, for example, you can visit it at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/railo-context/admin/server.cfm">http://127.0.0.1:8888/railo-context/admin/server.cfm</a>

<p>The Railo Web Administrator, for a specific website, is available at the virtual folder <em>/railo-context/admin/web.cfm</em> and is based on the host name of the url, so for example http://<em>site1</em>/railo-context/admin/web.cfm will allow you to set specific settings for <em>site1</em>, while http://<em>site2</em>/railo-context/admin/web.cfm will allow you to set specific settings for <em>site2</em>
